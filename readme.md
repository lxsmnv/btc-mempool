# Bitcoin Mempool

This project is an experimental application exploring the Bitcoin Mempool using the Rust programming language. The work is still in progress.

## Overview

The application connects to a Bitcoin peer and queries for mempool information. It uses the Rust language's powerful concurrency features and the Tokio framework for asynchronous programming.

## Features

- Connects to a Bitcoin peer using the peer-to-peer protocol
- Sends and receives network messages
- Queries for mempool information
- Handles network messages asynchronously

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```
